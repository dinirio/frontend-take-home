# Front-End take-home task: Create a simple Todo application

Todo application is a productivity application, for people to keep a record of their tasks, so they don’t have to keep all the tasks in their head. Todo application lets you create new todo item, lets you mark your todo item as completed, or allows you to delete your todo item. Please try to develop a similar application and feel free to add any styles to make the application look unique.
